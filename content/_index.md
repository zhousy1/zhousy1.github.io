  #             During the internship, I participated in the approach guidance technology research of on-orbit service spacecraft rendezvous and docking, and finally won the title of **Outstanding Intern**. 

  #             * The close approach guidance technology is mainly investigated. The Gaussian pseudospectral method is used for trajectory optimization, and LQR is used to complete the guidance process for Clohessy-Wiltshire (C-W) equations.
  #             * Typical task simulations are completed using Systems Tool Kit (STK). And the guidance error caused by measurement accuracy is analyzed.
