Hi! My name is Shiyu Zhou (周诗钰). I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/mne/) at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Gang Feng (IEEE Fellow)](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/bme/megfeng/), co-supervised by [Prof. Dong Sun (IEEE Fellow)](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/bme/medsun/).

<!-- My research focuses on cooperative control of multi agent system, particularly in trajectory and motion planning for aerial robots. My current goal is to achieve fully autonomous, agile flight in real-world environments, thereby enabling aerial robots to serve humans efficiently.
