abstract: This paper investigates the output group formation tracking problem for heterogeneous systems with collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance methods, and the group formation tracking error can be controlled within an arbitrarily small bound. Firstly, the distributed observers are proposed to estimate the leader's state for each group and the state of itself, respectively. Through constructing the desired potential fields and deviating to get the negative forces, the high safety control protocol is put forward. Moreover, the algorithm consisting of several equations and inequalities is given to calculate the parameters in the controller. By using Lyapunov stability theory, the stability of the errorâ€™ systems have been analyzed. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by an experiment about the atmospheric monitoring task.
