abstract: This study considers the time-varying group formation tracking control problem for general linear multi-agent systems with collision avoidance, where the multi-agent systems is divided into multiple subgroups, enabling followers to form prescribed formations and track trajectories provided by their respective leaders without collisions. Firstly, a distributed time-varying group formation tracking control protocol is introduced using only relative information among neighboring agents. Then, feasibility conditions under which multi-agent systems can successfully realize the time-varying group formation tracking without collisions are put forward. Utilizing Lyapunov stability theory, the convergence of the time-varying group formation tracking error systems is confirmed, ensuring the collision-free achievement of the desired formation. Finally, some simulation examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.
